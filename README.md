# Seesaw Simulation

A web-based simulation that demonstrates the physical concept of torque and balance using a seesaw mechanism. The project features real-time physics calculations, state persistence.

## 🧠 Thought Process & Design Decisions

### 1. Design & User Experience
- **Modern & Minimalist Layout:** My primary goal was to build a modern design structure. I preferred a minimalist layout centered on the page to ensure that the user can see the entire simulation, statistics, and history at a **single glance** without needing to scroll or search for information.
- **Visual Consistency (Color Coding):** I placed significant importance on using the weight colors within the UI design. The "Next Weight" indicator and the borders of the "History" items are dynamically styled to match the color of the generated weight. This creates a visual link between the data and the physical objects on the plank.

## 🤖 AI Assistance

I developed most of the core logic and structure myself, but I **occasionally** utilized AI assistance in specific areas:

- **CSS Styling:** I used AI to assist with specific visual details, such as gradients and polished effects, to enhance the interface.
